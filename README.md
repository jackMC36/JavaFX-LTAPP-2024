# Lottery-App-JavaFX

LANGUAGES USED: Java(JavaFX library), FXML, CSS 

DESCRIPTION: Project created for a french BDE named Adess in CLermont-Ferrand that chooses a randomly sourced gift from a list of gifts once you press on a button.
I created a GUI in JavaFX and used CSS as a stylesheet. The GUI has a paramater where you can choose the available gifts and select them. It has two buttons,
one to start a wheel spin and one to stop it. Once the wheel stops, and image appears with the gift that was generated.
