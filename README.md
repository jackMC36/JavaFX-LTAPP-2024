# Lottery-App-JavaFX

LANGUAGES USED: Java(JavaFX library), FXML, CSS 

DESCRIPTION: Project created for a french BDE named Adess in CLermont-Ferrand that chooses a randomly sourced gift from a list of gifts once you press on a button.
I created a GUI in JavaFX and used CSS as a stylesheet. The GUI has a paramater where you can choose the available gifts and select them (Radio Menu Item). It also has an option button where it takes to another fxml file to customise the color and other details of the main fxml file.

FILES:
- app.java (main Java file)
- Controler.java (Controller Class)
- style.css (main stylesheet)
- app.fxml (Main GUI file)
- logo.png

INTERFACES: Visual Studio Code and Scene Builder
