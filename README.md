# Lottery-App-JavaFX

Project created for a french BDE in Clermont-Ferrand that chooses a randomly sourced gift from a list of gifts once you press on a button. Created a GUI with a nice animation.

Details on JavaFX for future Projects:

/**
 * The main() method is ignored in correctly deployed JavaFX application.
 * main() serves only as fallback in case the application can not be
 * launched through deployment artifacts, e.g., in IDEs with limited FX
 * support. NetBeans ignores main().
 *
 * @param args the command line arguments
 */
public class app extends Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
